eg-title = Activate Event Planning Guide
eg-started = Get Started
eg-started-content = Who you target, where you host and how you promote your event will all depend on the type of event you’re running.
eg-started-content-1 = Decide which activity you will run
eg-started-content-2 = Estimate how many people will attend
eg-started-content-3 = Define objectives
eg-venue = Find a venue
eg-venue-content = When considering where to hold your event, look for a comfortable, flexible space that’s appropriate for the number of participants you expect. Be creative – cafes, community centers, co-working spaces, libraries and hackerspaces are great places to start. Since your event will hopefully have more than one or two people, you’ll need tables for each participant and room to move around. Ensure there is reliable Internet, enough power outlets and good lighting.
eg-experience = Design a fun experience
eg-experience-content = Your event should feel like a party! A few simple tricks to help create a welcoming, creative atmosphere include playing music, bringing snacks and providing name tags. Having an intro activity or icebreaker is a great way to get everyone socializing.
eg-schedule = Schedule
eg-schedule-content = Plan your schedule ahead of time but be flexible; your participants might surprise you with interesting questions or challenges to explore. Identify early on what materials are needed for your scheduled activities to run smoothly. A checklist of things you will need for set-up/during/after is very useful. Don’t forget to leave yourself adequate prep time and if you’re a Rep don’t forget to set up the event on the Reps Portal (<wikiLink>instructions</wikiLink>).
eg-promotion = Promotion
eg-promotion-content = There are many ways to promote your event that will create attention and draw more attendees.
eg-strategy = Recruitment Strategy
eg-strategy-content = Decide on your attendance goal. how many will you have to invite to make sure that many people RSVP? make a list of people you will invite. decide when you will call/email. ask people to make a hard commitment. Email everyone who RSVPs during 48 hours before event to reconfirm so fewer people flake.

Some events are BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) in which case it is good to send a reminder to individuals to not forget their laptops the day before the event. If individuals are unable to provide their own laptops, consider using a space where you can access a computer room or laptops. Another idea is to contact local tech organizations or community computer labs that have access to computers and ask them to sponsor equipment for the event in exchange for promotion. When deciding how many computers you need don’t forget that you can have participants working in pairs or bigger groups. It’s a good idea to try and have an extra laptop on hand for participants just in case of any technical problems.
eg-backup = Back-Up Plan
eg-backup-content = Unfortunately, tech problems are an all too familiar part of events. No matter the preparation, wireless networks or computers can cause unexpected issues.

Setting up a sign-in table gives you the opportunity to catch people when they first arrive so you can get the names of attendees and contact details so that you can send out thank yous, links, updates, and invites to future events. You may also want to give out name tags so it’s easier for people to meet and start talking. You can play the name tag game and ask people to list their favorite technology, video game, tv show etc. under their name to help get conversations started. Don’t be afraid to get creative and help people break the ice!
