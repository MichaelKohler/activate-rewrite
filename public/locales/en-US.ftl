If your event meets the requirements laid out in the activity, there is a fund available of up to $150 USD per event. This can be used for only the following items/services:
faq-budget-answer-2 = Locally produced stickers and/or other small items (only for an event for over 50 people)

faq-budget-answer-6 = For some activities, extra budget is available for special needs. For example, VR headsets for the WebVR Camp activity. Details will be available on the relevant activity pages.
faq-budget-answer-7 = To make the request, you will need to make a Reps budget request. If you are not a Rep, please contact a local Rep to help you. We will fast-track valid requests, which are ones that meet the requirements of the activity. For larger budget requests, it will be processed like any other Reps budget request and there is no guarantee it will be approved and even if so, whether it will be on time.
faq-swag-title = Can I request swag for these activities?
faq-swag-answer = In the case you need swag you can either request it via the <formLink>swag request form</formLink> or <produceLink>produce on your own</produceLink>. If you are not a Rep, you can also ask a nearby Rep to file the request for you. In all cases your request will be evaluated by the bug wrangler before being approved/rejected.
