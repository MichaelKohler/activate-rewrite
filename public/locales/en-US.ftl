eg-title = Activate Event Planning Guide

eg-started-content = Who you target, where you host and how you promote your event will all depend on the type of event you’re running.
eg-started-content-1 = Decide which activity you will run

eg-started-content-3 = Define objectives
eg-venue = Find a venue
eg-venue-content = When considering where to hold your event, look for a comfortable, flexible space that’s appropriate for the number of participants you expect. Be creative – cafes, community centers, co-working spaces, libraries and hackerspaces are great places to start. Since your event will hopefully have more than one or two people, you’ll need tables for each participant and room to move around. Ensure there is reliable Internet, enough power outlets and good lighting.
eg-experience = Design a fun experience
eg-experience-content = Your event should feel like a party! A few simple tricks to help create a welcoming, creative atmosphere include playing music, bringing snacks and providing name tags. Having an intro activity or icebreaker is a great way to get everyone socializing.
eg-schedule = Schedule
eg-schedule-content = Plan your schedule ahead of time but be flexible; your participants might surprise you with interesting questions or challenges to explore. Identify early on what materials are needed for your scheduled activities to run smoothly. A checklist of things you will need for set-up/during/after is very useful. Don’t forget to leave yourself adequate prep time and if you’re a Rep don’t forget to set up the event on the Reps Portal (<wikiLink>instructions</wikiLink>).
eg-promotion = Promotion
eg-promotion-content = There are many ways to promote your event that will create attention and draw more attendees.
eg-strategy = Recruitment Strategy
eg-strategy-content = Decide on your attendance goal. how many will you have to invite to make sure that many people RSVP? make a list of people you will invite. decide when you will call/email. ask people to make a hard commitment. Email everyone who RSVPs during 48 hours before event to reconfirm so fewer people flake.

eg-tech = Tech
eg-tech-content = When you’re teaching the web, having the right tech set-up and a good plan B is vital to the success of your event.
eg-equipment = Equipment
eg-equipment-content = Determine your tech needs early on and decide whether you need laptops, projectors, AV equipment, extension cords and power cords. Some events are BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) in which case it is good to send a reminder to individuals to not forget their laptops the day before the event. If individuals are unable to provide their own laptops, consider using a space where you can access a computer room or laptops. Another idea is to contact local tech organizations or community computer labs that have access to computers and ask them to sponsor equipment for the event in exchange for promotion. When deciding how many computers you need don’t forget that you can have participants working in pairs or bigger groups. It’s a good idea to try and have an extra laptop on hand for participants just in case of any technical problems.
eg-backup = Back-Up Plan
eg-backup-content = Unfortunately, tech problems are an all too familiar part of events. No matter the preparation, wireless networks or computers can cause unexpected issues. If a few computers are malfunctioning, perhaps ask participants to buddy up on computers and work in groups. We suggest having a couple offline activities prepared in the case of an emergency.
eg-running = Running Your event
eg-setup = Set-up
eg-setup-content = When preparing for event, be sure to arrive early to set-up the space as needed. Doing a walkthrough before the event will make things much easier when it’s time to go. This will allow you plenty of time in case unexpected issues arise. Remind your co-leads to welcome newcomers, and make sure your co-leaders know what their jobs are.
eg-welcome = Welcome & Registration
eg-welcome-content = A good first impression goes a long way towards helping someone feel comfortable and happy at your event.
eg-welcome-welcome = Welcome
eg-welcome-welcome-content = Thank everyone for coming. Welcome your new and old participants and make sure to do introductions for new people.
eg-signin = Sign-in
eg-signin-content = Once your event gets going it may be very difficult to keep track of who is there. Setting up a sign-in table gives you the opportunity to catch people when they first arrive so you can get the names of attendees and contact details so that you can send out thank yous, links, updates, and invites to future events. You may also want to give out name tags so it’s easier for people to meet and start talking. You can play the name tag game and ask people to list their favorite technology, video game, tv show etc. under their name to help get conversations started. Don’t be afraid to get creative and help people break the ice!

Be sure to ask what the participants would like to do next. Provide links to the campus websites where they can continue learning new skills. Later, conduct a debrief with participating organizations and volunteers, if you had any. Gather feedback and ask if the event was a good way for them to serve their communities. Discuss ways to continuing hacking together to keep the momentum going.
